# 1.0 Attacks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities

## 1.1 Compare and contrast different types of social engineering techniques

- **Phishing**: Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by disguising as a trustworthy entity in electronic communication.
- **Spear Phishing**: Targeted phishing aimed at a specific individual or organization.
- **Whaling**: Phishing attack directed specifically at senior executives and other high-profile targets.
- **Vishing**: Voice phishing conducted over the phone.
- **Smishing**: Phishing using SMS messages.

## 1.2 Given a scenario, analyze potential indicators to determine the type of attack

- **Indicators of Compromise (IoC)**: Signs that an attack has taken place, such as unusual network traffic, changes in file integrity, or anomalies in system performance.
- **Pharming**: Redirecting users from a legitimate website to a fraudulent one to steal credentials.
- **URL Redirection**: Using malicious URLs to redirect traffic to harmful sites.

## 1.3 Explain penetration testing concepts

- **Black Box Testing**: Testing without prior knowledge of the system.
- **White Box Testing**: Testing with full knowledge of the system.
- **Gray Box Testing**: Testing with partial knowledge of the system.

## 1.4 Explain vulnerability scanning concepts

- **Non-intrusive Scan**: A passive scan that does not affect system operations.
- **Intrusive Scan**: An active scan that can affect system operations.
- **Credentialed vs. Non-credentialed**: Scans performed with or without login credentials.
